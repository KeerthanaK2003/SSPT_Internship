# SSPT-Internship
Internship at Shri Shasha Prayathi Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (SSPT)  for the duration of 3 months mainly focusing on FPGA. 

Day 01 (Sep 1, 2025) -> Installed relevant softwares and got familiarised with those- Quartus Prime and ModelSim with the help of guide, worked on a simple half adder simulation and understanding.

Day 02 (Sep 2, 2025) -> Designed the full adder, logic gates and 4:1 mux verilog code in Quartus Prime and verified the outputs using Modelsim. Then I was exposed to DE-10 Lite board,the pins and other components in that board, and got started with half adder ,integrating to the board and verified the output by LED, by giving inputs at Switch.

Day 03 (Sep 3, 2025) -> Integrated DE- 10 Lite board with full adder, logic gates verilog code and verified the output using the board. Also learnt some basics of Nios II.

Day 04 (Sep 4, 2025) -> Today , actually I had taken sick leave, yet workon simple project 2:1 MUX. I also studied basics of system verilog.

Day 05 (Sep 5, 2025) ->
